                    <h6 class="theme-color lead">Professional Tutor - Math, Physics and Computer Science</h6>
                    <p>My name is <b>Mitchell Daddario</b>, and I'm passionate about helping students achieve their maximum potential in math, physics & computer science! I've been a private tutor for the past 2 years and have personally helped hundreds of students improve their grades & understanding in these subjects. <b>My goal is to empower students to become independent problem solvers</b>.</p>
                    <p>I'm from Buffalo, NY and graduated from Sweet Home high school in 2015. In high school, I found my love for math and science through taking the AP courses my school offered. I received 5's on the AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism and AP Chemistry exams.</p>
                    <p>After high school, I attended Lehigh University where I graduated with high honors in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. During my Sophomore year I was inducted into the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society for my academic achievements. I was also a member of the D1 cross country and track teams where I was named to the Patriot League Academic Honor Roll every season. When I wasn't busy with my coursework or running, I would always lend a hand to my fellow classmates who were struggling with their engineering courses. College is where I found my passion for tutoring.</p>
                    <p>After graduating, I started working as a software engineer. While I loved coding, I also really loved teaching, so outside of work I started tutoring on online platforms such as Varsity Tutors & Paper. For a year I tutored on these platforms helping students & honing my tutoring craft. After 1 year on these platforms I decided to start my own private tutoring business so that I could provide a more custom experience for my students.</p>  
                    <p>Currently, I live in Austin, TX and work as a software engineer at Silicon Labs. My main hobbies include reading, biking, skiing, tennis & travel!</p>
