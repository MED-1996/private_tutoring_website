                    <h6 class="theme-color lead">Professional Tutor - Math, Physics and Computer Science</h6>
                    <p>My name is <b>Mitchell Daddario</b>, and I'm passionate about helping students achieve their maximum potential in math, physics & computer science! I've been a private tutor for the past 2 years and have personally helped hundreds of students improve their grades & understanding in these subjects. <b>My goal is to empower students to become independent problem solvers</b>.</p>
                    <p>I'm from Buffalo, NY and graduated from Sweet Home high school in 2015. In high school, I was obsessed with math & physics, so much so that I independently studied for 2 math/physics AP exams my senior year! In addition to my academics I was also an elite high school runner. I ran a 4:16 mile my senior year!</p>
                    <p>After high school, I attended Lehigh University where I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and computer science. I really enjoyed college because I was exposed to all the possible routes I could take in engineering. The route I became most interested in was computer science! In college I ran D1 cross country and track. I also spent a summer in Malaysia doing research at UTP.</p>
                    <p>Since graduating from Lehigh, I've worked as a software engineer at both small & large companies. I also started tutoring students one year after graduating, initially working for tutoring companies such as Varsity Tutors and Paper. One year later I began my own private tutoring practice so that I could provide a more custom tutoring experience for my students.</p>  
                    <p>Currently, I live in Austin, TX and work as a software engineer for Silicon Labs. My main hobbies include reading, coding, biking, skiing, tennis & travel!</p>
