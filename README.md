# Mitchell Daddario Private Tutoring :man_teacher:

This repository contains the code for my tutoring website. The website was made using Django & Bootstrap. There are currently 4 pages on my site, they are described below:

* Home Page - Describes my services & has a form that new students can fill out.
* Pricing Page - Shows my hourly rate.

The goal of the site is to have my own space where students can learn about my services and sign up for tutoring!
